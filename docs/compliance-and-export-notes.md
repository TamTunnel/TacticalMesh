- **Open-source software** with fully transparent source code available for security review
- Built on **widely-used, standard technologies** (Python, PostgreSQL, React) with no proprietary components

### What Apache TacticalMesh IS NOT:

- Does not include any **classified information** or classified algorithms
- Does not include any **cryptographic implementations** beyond standard TLS/HTTPS for transport security
- Does not include any **radio frequency** or **waveform** implementations
- Does not include any **targeting**, **weapons**, or **kill chain** capabilities
- Does not include any **signals intelligence** or **electronic warfare** capabilities

## U.S. Export Control Considerations

### General Information

The Apache TacticalMesh project has been designed with the following export control considerations in mind:

1. **ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations):**  
   To the best of our knowledge, Apache TacticalMesh does not contain defense articles or technical data as defined under the U.S. Munitions List (USML). The software is a general-purpose networking tool with no inherent military-specific functionality.

2. **EAR (Export Administration Regulations):**  
   Apache TacticalMesh is believed to be classified under EAR99 as publicly available, open-source software without controlled encryption beyond standard authentication protocols. However, this assessment is informal and not a legal determination.

3. **Open Source Exception:**  
   Under 15 CFR § 734.3(b)(3), published open-source software is generally not subject to the EAR. Apache TacticalMesh is publicly available without access restrictions.

### Disclaimers

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Not Legal Advice**
>
> The information in this document is provided for general informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Export control regulations are complex and subject to change. The Apache TacticalMesh project and its contributors make no representations regarding the export classification of this software.
>
> **End-users and integrators are solely responsible for:**
> - Obtaining their own export control classification and legal review
> - Ensuring compliance with all applicable U.S. and international export control laws
> - Obtaining any necessary export licenses before transferring this software internationally
> - Compliance with all applicable national laws in their jurisdiction

## NATO and Allied Nations Considerations

For organizations in NATO member states and allied nations:

1. **National Regulations:** Many NATO countries have their own export control regimes that may impose additional requirements. Users must ensure compliance with their national regulations.

2. **Technology Transfer:** Transfer of this software, including to contractors or partner nations, may require approval under national technology transfer regulations.

3. **Classification Handling:** If this software is integrated into classified systems, users are responsible for handling the resulting system according to applicable security classifications.

4. **Interoperability:** While designed with interoperability in mind, actual integration with military systems will require appropriate security reviews and certifications.

## Open Source Benefits for Defense Applications

### Transparency and Auditability

- All source code is publicly available for security review
- No hidden backdoors or undisclosed functionality
- Independent verification by multiple parties is possible

### Security Through Openness

- Vulnerabilities can be identified and reported by the security community
- Rapid patching and updates are possible
- No reliance on "security through obscurity"

### Audit Trail and Accountability

Apache TacticalMesh includes built-in features to support compliance and oversight:

- **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** All operator actions are logged with timestamps, user identity, and action details
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Clear delineation of permissions (Admin, Operator, Observer)
- **API-First Design:** All actions occur through documented API endpoints, enabling external monitoring

## Modification and Integration Guidelines

When modifying or integrating Apache TacticalMesh:

1. **Export Control Review:** Any modifications that add encryption, military-specific functionality, or integration with controlled systems should undergo export control review.

2. **Security Classification:** Integration with classified systems may result in classification requirements for the integrated system.

3. **Contribution Guidelines:** Contributions to the open-source project must not include export-controlled, classified, or proprietary information.

4. **License Compliance:** Modifications must comply with the Apache License 2.0 terms.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Radio and Cryptographic Integration Warning**
> 
> Integration of Apache TacticalMesh with specific radio systems, waveforms, or cryptographic modules (beyond standard TLS) may **change the export control classification** of the resulting integrated system and is **explicitly out of scope** for the core Apache TacticalMesh project.
> 
> Examples that may trigger export control review:
> - Integration with military radios (e.g., SINCGARS, MUOS, Link 16)
> - Custom cryptographic implementations or algorithms
> - Hardware security module (HSM) integration
> - FIPS-validated cryptography implementations
> - Classified or proprietary waveform implementations
> 
> Users integrating such systems should consult export control counsel **before** development.
