## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Apache TacticalMesh team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Preferred Method:** Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/TamTunnel/Apache-TacticalMesh/security/advisories/new) to report vulnerabilities privately.

**Alternative:** Email security concerns to the repository maintainers via the contact information in the repository.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Affected versions** if known
4. **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
5. **Suggested remediation** if you have one

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 72 hours
- **Initial assessment:** Within 7 days
- **Status updates:** Every 14 days until resolved

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Warranty.** This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. See the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE) for details.

> [!CAUTION]
> **No Accreditation.** Apache TacticalMesh has NOT received any government security accreditation, Authority to Operate (ATO), or certification. Organizations deploying this software in government or defense environments are solely responsible for obtaining necessary authorizations.

### Security Features (v0.1.0)

| Feature | Implementation Status |
|---------|----------------------|
| Transport Encryption | ✅ HTTPS/TLS (standard libraries) |
| Authentication | ✅ JWT tokens with configurable expiration |
| Authorization | ✅ Role-based access control (Admin, Operator, Observer) |
| Audit Logging | ✅ Timestamped logs of all significant actions |
| Password Storage | ✅ bcrypt hashing |
| Input Validation | ✅ Pydantic schema validation |

### What This Project Does NOT Provide

This project explicitly does **NOT** include:

- ❌ Cryptographic implementations beyond standard TLS
- ❌ Classified algorithms or data handling
- ❌ Hardware security module (HSM) integration
- ❌ FIPS-validated cryptography
- ❌ Export-controlled technology

### Compliance Responsibility

Organizations deploying Apache TacticalMesh are responsible for:

1. Obtaining any required security authorizations (ATO, IL certifications, etc.)
2. Conducting their own security assessments

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

When deploying Apache TacticalMesh:

1. **Change default credentials immediately** after initial setup
2. **Use HTTPS** for all controller communications
3. **Restrict network access** to the controller using firewalls
4. **Review audit logs** regularly for suspicious activity
5. **Keep dependencies updated** via Dependabot or manual review
6. **Run in isolated environments** with minimal privileges
